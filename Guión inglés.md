# Introduction:

Have you got an idea? Do you want to start a business adventure and you don't know how? Have you got no funding nor interested collaborators in your project? Pay attention to the video, you may discover a solution for your problem.

Do the words Blockchain or Smart Contract come to your mind? Thanks to these technologies you can create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, DAO for its acronym, and the best part, in an easy way and without previous knowledge of the inner workings of Blockchain.

In this video, We are going to explain what a DAO is, we will talk about Aragon, a tool for creating this kind of organizations.

# Motivation:

Aragon is an DAPP which works on Ethereum's Blockchain. If you don't know much about this, we encourage you search for some information, but don't worry, you don't have to know anything to continue with this video.

Aragon's founders, inspired by their own personal experience, were worried about all the great ideas which cannot be developed due to economic or administrative obstacles.

They realized that, in most scenarios, technologies turn into oppressive and manipulative tools, instead of a method for getting the most out of creativity. They also realized that tradicional organizations waste a lot of budget on administrative actions and time in order to make transactions to other companies.

There was no escape from this inefficient and expensive old word, so they tried to reach for a solution. This is how Aragon is born.

# Explain what is a DAO:

So then, what does DAO mean? It’s hard to explain, in fact, there is not a really precise definition for it, and it becomes even harder to explain without knowledge about blockchain. What we are going to do is see the main differences from a traditional company.

* Let's imagine some company A wants to make a transaction to another Company B for a service. This transaction is not immediate, because there are other centralized companies external to A and B that take part on it, such as Banks, the State, and, in some cases, if we are dealing with an important transaction, management companies and even lawyers. It is obvious that this generates unnecessary loss of time and money. How does DAOs fix this? Let’s go back a little bit. Let’s imagine some DAO A wants to make a transaction to another DAO B for a service. That’s it! Transaction done! Fast, straightforward, and at a ridiculous price...But, how do we make sure this is safe? What if A tries to trick B? What if the service provided by B is not what was expected?
This is where Smart Contracts come into action, software that is executed not only by DAO A and B, but also DAO C, D, E… and, in the case of Ethereum, thousands of devices that check the contract meets the requirements. No clowning around! Impossible to trick a whole community!


* Now imagine that you are finishing your degree, and your head is filled with lots of great ideas. Maybe you didn’t have to force your imagination, and this description matches you perfectly. You would love to work for yourself, but you know you need money, time, and assume great risks.
You should know 98% of StartUps break between the first 2 years!
The simple fact of creating a company needs of knowledge and money you may not have. Even creating a DAO by yourself also needs of advanced programming knowledge, but with Aragon, is as simple as clicking your mouse a few times.

* And the best part, don’t worry about expensive servers, hardware or software. Your organization is decentralized on Ethereum’s net!

# So, what is Aragon?

So…, what is Aragon? To make it short and simple, Aragon is a DAO that works on Ethereum’s blockchain, and manages other DAOs created by its users, but this creating is totally transparent for the users, all the hard work on Ethereum it is done by Aragon!

# Principal funcionalities:

But what else can be done with Aragon aside from creating our own organization? Let’s see some of their main features.

Aragon suggest democratic organization based on voting, in order to assure decentralization and maximum transparency. Every single change in the organization must be approved by vote. They might be inside changes, or changes related to the activity of the company.

We can also create our own tokens, deciding its properties to our own, which can be assigned to members of the organization, giving voting or economic power. This assignments must be approved by vote, meeting the democratic rules established by the organization.

In every DAO created with Aragon, we can decide roles for our members, each with its own permissions. Just as any other organization! Each permissions allows to execute certain actions. As always, this management is visible and take into voting.

Do you want to use external modules? You can! In order to get great flexibility and customization for each organization, Aragon allows the addition of modules which give more features, such as Liquid Democracy, which allows the user to vest his voting power in delegates or Espresso, for encrypting and sharing data inside the organization.

And the very best part, every single financial transaction is visible. Aragon has its own tool for tracking every single transaction done by the organization. Impossible to become more transparent!
 
# Cases of use:

Does this sound futuristic to you? Well, there are already lots of Dao’s all around the world. Some of them even with millionaire investments in the first hours of their creation, such as Aragon.

* Imagine a collaborative news organization, with thousands of journalist around the world, every one working from their home, where nows are send and verified by the DAO.

* Or for example, and organization that manages budget in a company, easing the process of making collaborative investments or venture capital.

* You can even make an organization for restaurant guides, with verified reviews, transparent, and fair with owners of establishments.

This are only some examples of what can me accomplished with Aragon. Some of them are already operational. But, how do you want to contribute?
